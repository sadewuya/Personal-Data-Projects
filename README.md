# Student Stress Metrics Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes survey data on student academic stress to identify key drivers of stress levels among undergraduates and graduates. Using exploratory data analysis and visualization, we uncover relationships between peer pressure, family expectations, study environment, coping strategies, and stress outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle â€“ Student Academic Stress Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/poushal02/student-academic-stress-real-world-dataset)
- Data type: Categorical + ordinal (1â€“5 scale)
- Target variable: Self-reported academic stress index

## ðŸ›  Techniques
- Data Cleaning (renaming, formatting, handling categorical values)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (descriptive stats, distributions, correlations)
- Visualizations (heatmaps, bar plots, boxplots, histograms)
- Feature Engineering (encoding categorical features)
- Correlation & regression-based exploratory modeling

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Peer pressure and family academic expectations were the strongest stress predictors.
- Students in noisy study environments reported higher stress.
- Effective coping strategies (problem-solving) correlated with lower stress.
- Academic competition perceptions were linked with increased stress.

## ðŸš€ Key Learnings
- Stress is influenced by both **external social/academic pressures** and **internal coping mechanisms**.
- EDA is a powerful first step in uncovering drivers of well-being in education data.

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps
- Apply predictive modeling (logistic regression, decision trees) to classify high vs. low stress.
- Test intervention hypotheses (simulate reduced peer pressure or improved environments).
